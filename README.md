# SpaceData

This project will be for a private space launch company.  I will collect some raw data and improve the quality of data by performing data wrangling.   Utilizing my SQL skills, I will query the data to gather insights. I will extract further insights by applying statistical analysis and data visualization to see directly how variables might be related to each other and subsequently splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in the data.  Finally, I will build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights.
