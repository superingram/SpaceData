# SpaceData

This project will be for a private space launch company.  

I will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

I will collect some raw data and improve the quality of data by performing data wrangling.   Utilizing my SQL skills, I will query the data to gather insights. I will extract further insights by applying statistical analysis and data visualization to see directly how variables might be related to each other and subsequently splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in the data.  Finally, I will build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights.
